From your terminal in the root directory of this project,

    javac -d bin src\*.java

First, Start the server by running the Server class.
    
    java -cp bin\ Server

Second, Start the client by running the Client class.

    java -cp bin\ Client

Follow the prompts in the client interface to connect to the server and participate in chat rooms.

## What I have learned
1. How to use sockets and TCP connections to create a client-server application in Java.
2. How to send and receive data over a network connection.
3. How to design and implement a simple chat application with multiple chat rooms.
4. The importance of thread safety when working with concurrent connections.

## Here is a Demonstration of the application step by step.

#### Initial state:

#### View list of existing chat rooms:

First a room has to be created in order to see the room list. Via `-createRoom room_Name`

Now list rooms by `-rooms`

#### Check room capacity and restrict access to full capacity rooms

Now initiating 6 clients in total, 5 will be joining in one room, the 6th client wonâ€™t be able to join on that room.
